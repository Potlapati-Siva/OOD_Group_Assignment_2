 This Repository contains the research documents on "Impact of Code  Smells on Software Modularity" 

**Abstract**
This empirical study examines the impact of code smells, such as feature envy and God classes, on software modularity using the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) methodology. By analyzing various software projects, it investigates how code smells affect modularity measures, providing valuable insights for improving code maintainability and system flexibility.

**Findings**
All the classes which have highest CBO,LCOM,RFC values have most number of the code smells
